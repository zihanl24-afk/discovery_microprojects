    "The United States' National Weather Service (NWS) allows, for free, \"developers access to critical forecasts, alerts, and observations, along with other weather data.\"  When any organization provides developers access to data, the most common way to provide data is through an Application Programming Interface or API.  An API is simply a documented and structured way that data is provided, so that a developer is able to use the data in a reliable and predictable way.  For example, you can find the full documentation of their API at: [https://www.weather.gov/documentation/services-web-api](https://www.weather.gov/documentation/services-web-api).\n",
